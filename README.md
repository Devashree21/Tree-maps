# Tree-maps
Building Treemaps using Python

**Here is a short FAQ about this repository**

**1) What is this repository about?**

In this repository, we are going to build treemaps in 3 different ways in Python.
The jupyter notebook (.ipynb) as well as this readme provide the code and all the relevant information about this tutorial.

**2) What is Treemap?**

A treemap is a special type of chart for visualization using a set of nested rectangles of categorical data that is preferably hierarchical.

**3) Which libraries has been used for creation for dashboard?**

For this tutorial, we have used Seaborn+Squarify, Pygal and Plotly Express to build treemaps in Python.

A sample dataframe has been created using Pandas function. This dataframe has been used for building all three treemaps.

**Details of this tutorial and basics of Treemap charts are discussed in my article published on Analytics Vidhya**
